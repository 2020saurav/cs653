The Google transport networking crew (QUIC, TCP, etc..) deserve a shout out for identifying and fixing a nearly decade old Linux kernel TCP bug that I think will have an outsized impact on performance and efficiency for the Internet.

Their patch addresses a problem with cubic congestion control, which is the default algorithm on many Linux distributions. The problem can be roughly summarized as the controller mistakenly characterizing the lack of congestion reports over a quiescent period as positive evidence that the network is not congested and therefore it should send at a faster rate when sending resumes. When put like this, its obvious that an endpoint that is not moving any traffic cannot use the lack of errors as information in its feedback loop.
